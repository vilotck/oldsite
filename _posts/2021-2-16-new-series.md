i am planning to continue with two new series:
random indie games,
2008's nostalgia.

ok i am calling it 2008's nostalgia because that is when people born in 2006-2008 would have played these games
i was born 2008 so yeah
the games i will be playing are:
lego hobbit (already done but i wanna make a second version as i cut out my favourite part by accident... its in the uncut video version though)
lego harry potter 5-7 (i only had 1-4 for like a couple days as a rent thing... i do have 1-4 on the wii but its easier to play 5-7 on the pc as i have no capture card)
toy story 3 xbox 360 (i might just be playing the game on pc... i have it installed on my mac i think so i can just move it to my new pc...)
ratchet and clank (i might not be able to play it this year as i have no capture card for ps2 or anything)
terraria (i can definetly play this soon)
minecraft (wish i could play it on xbox360 but no capture card, i played it first on xbox360 so it would have made more sense)
steambot chronicles (im playing it on a ps2 emulator... actually i could play ratchet and clank on an emulator so mmm)

yeah there will probably be more just hold on a second
